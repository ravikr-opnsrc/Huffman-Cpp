# Huffman Encoding  

This C++ program demonstrates the Huffman encoding and decoding technique, a lossless data compression algorithm. Huffman coding efficiently encodes a given string into a binary representation.

## Features

- **Huffman Encoding**: Efficiently encodes an input string into binary using the Huffman coding technique, based on character frequencies.

- **Priority Queue**: Utilizes a priority queue data structure to construct the Huffman tree by merging nodes with the lowest frequencies.

- **In-Order Traversal**: Implements an in-order traversal of the Huffman tree to explore and print values associated with each node.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.

2. Run the executable.

3. Enter the input string when prompted.

4. The program will display the encoded binary representation.

## Example

Input:
```
Original string: "ravi"
```

Output:
```
Encoded string: "00011011"
 
```
